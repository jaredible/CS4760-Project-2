# CS4760 Project 2: Concurrent UNIX Processes and Shared Memory

##### ADJUSTMENTS
- Instead of implementing a shared clock, I just used time() in palin (Approved by Bhatia)

##### ISSUES
- Upon signaling, a child process may not terminate. I'm terminating them using a PGID.
  After forking, a child process is assigned a PGID. So, since it's possible to signal
  between the time of forking and assigning the PGID to the child process, the child process
  may never terminate properly. Although, all child processes will be terminated most of
  the time during testing.

##### EXECUTION
```
./master -h
./master [-n x] [-s x] [-t time] infile
```

##### CHANGELOG
